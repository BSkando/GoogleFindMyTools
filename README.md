# GoogleFindMyTools

This repository includes some useful tools for understanding how Google's Find My Device Network works. It will be extended over time.

### What's possible?
Currently, it is possible to query Find My Device trackers and their corresponding encrypted locations. You can try out this code by running main.py. It is recommended to use an IDE such as PyCharm to run the code. All packages in requirements.txt need to be installed.

### Known Issues
- Automatic decryption of locations is not currently supported.
- First registration for Cloud Messaging takes a while, be patient.

### Disclaimer
If you use any code or information, you must acknowledge this repository in your work.
